# Smart Evaluation System

## Overview
The Smart Evaluation System is an innovative tool that leverages the OpenAI API (mainly ChatGpt 4 tarbo, ChatGpt 3.5) to evaluate or check answer scripts with minimal effort. It primarily checks the answer script using AI. Users only need to provide the answer script and teacher's feedback on our website. Within a minute, the marks get generated along with a review of the paper. The review shows the quality of the answer, indicating if a teacher can improve marks in any part.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: HTML and Tailwind CSS
- **Interface between Frontend and Backend**: Flask

## How It Works
1. **Upload the Answer Script**: Users upload the answer script to our website.
2. **Provide Teacher's Feedback**: Users provide the teacher's feedback for the answer script.
3. **AI Evaluation**: Our system evaluates the answer script using AI and generates the marks.
4. **Review Generation**: Along with the marks, our system also generates a review of the paper, showing the quality of the answer and indicating areas of improvement.
